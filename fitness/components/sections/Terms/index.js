                        Central Avenue, Apt A41, Hartsdale, NY 10530 (“TRNHRD, Inc.,” “we,” “us” and “our”). The

                        Personal Trainers to find each other, communicate with each other, and arrange for the provision of

                    <h2>2. TRNHRD Service</h2>
                    <p>2.1. Nature of the TRNHRD Service. The TRNHRD Service consists of a mobile
                        application, and, if any, other related tools, support, and services that Trainees
                        (“Trainees”) and providers of Personal Training Services (“Personal Trainers”) can use to
                        find, communicate with and interact with each other. Section 2.2 defines the Personal
                        Training Services that each Trainer and Trainee agree upon (“Personal Training
                        Services”).
                    </p>

                    <p>2.2. Personal Training Services. Either the Personal Trainer or the Trainee can request to
                        connect to the other to procure Personal Training Services in which the Personal Trainer
                        provides a workout program for the Trainee. All requests are subject to acceptance by
                        the receiving Party. The receiving Party is not obligated to accept any request for
                        Personal Training Services and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. Once the
                        Parties accept the request, the Parties agree to honor the price and other terms of the
                        engagement. The transaction of the procurement of Personal Training Services is
                        complete at the moment when the Personal Trainer makes available the Personal
                        Training Services to the Trainee. Upon payment, the Personal Trainer agrees to deliver or
                        make available the Personal Training Services at which point the Personal Trainer and
                        the Trainee agree that the Personal Training Services are deemed delivered (“Delivered”
                        or “Delivery”).
                    </p>

                    <p>2.3. TRNHRD, Inc. does not provide Personal Training Services. TRNHRD, Inc. is a neutral
                        venue for Personal Trainers and Trainees to connect for the provision of Personal
                        Training Services. TRNHRD, Inc. is not a Personal Trainer and does not provide
                        Personal Training Services. We make no representations or warranties about the quality
                        of Personal Training Services or about your interactions and dealings with Personal
                        Trainers or Trainees as the case may be. Personal Trainers listed on the TRNHRD
                        Service are not under the direction or control of TRNHRD, Inc., and Personal Trainers
                        determine in their own discretion how to provide Personal Training Services. TRNHRD,
                        Inc. does not employ, recommend or endorse Personal Trainers, and, to the maximum
                        extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the
                        performance or conduct of Personal Trainers or Trainees, whether online or offline.
                        TRNHRD, Inc. does not screen Personal Trainers or Trainees. You should exercise
                        caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Personal Trainer,
                        procuring Personal Training Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the
                        TRNHRD Service. Trainees and Personal Trainers are solely responsible for making
                        decisions that are in their own best interests <br /><br />

                        Upon the Personal Trainer’s and the Trainee’s agreement for the Personal Trainer to
                        provide Personal Training Services, the Personal Trainer agrees to Delivery of the
                        Personal Training Services within five days.
                    </p>

                    <p>2.4. Release. Subject to Section 13 below, TRNHRD, Inc. has no liability for any claims,
                        injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your
                        interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Personal
                        Trainers and Trainees, whether online or offline. You acknowledge and agree that, to the
                        maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE OR PROVISION OF
                        PERSONAL TRAINING SERVICES OR BOTH IS AT YOUR SOLE AND
                        EXCLUSIVE RISK.
                    </p>

                    <p>2.5. Transactions are between Trainees and Personal Trainers. The TRNHRD Service may be
                        used to find and offer Personal Training Services and to facilitate payment, but all
                        transactions conducted via the TRNHRD Service are between Trainees and Personal
                        Trainers. You agree that TRNHRD, Inc. has no liability for damages associated with
                        Personal Training Services or resulting from any other transactions between You and the
                        TRNHRD Service.
                    </p>

                    <p>2.6. Trainees are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Personal Trainers. Trainees are solely
                        responsible for evaluating the suitability of Personal Trainers for the services they offer
                        to provide. TRNHRD, Inc. does not endorse reviews of Personal Trainers by other
                        Trainees that may be available via the TRNHRD Service, and TRNHRD, Inc. makes no
                        commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        8.1. Currency. All fees, deductible amounts and other payments referenced on, or charged
                        through, the TRNHRD Service are listed and payable in local currency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.2. Fees for Trainees. Trainees may purchase Personal Training Services from a Personal
                        Trainer pursuant to Section 2.2. As a Trainee, you enter into a transaction with the
                        Personal Trainer when you agree to procure Personal Training Services pursuant to
                        Section 2.2, and you agree to pay the total amount you and the Personal Trainer agreed
                        to which may includes service fees payable to TRNHRD, Inc. The Personal Trainer, not
                        TRNHRD, Inc., is responsible for performing the Personal Training Services. Where
                        required by law, the amount charged will be inclusive of applicable taxes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.3. Fees for Personal Trainers. Personal Trainers may agree to provide Personal Training
                        Services as described in Section 2.2. Once the Personal Training Services are Delivered,
                        you agree to honor the price you and the Personal Trainer agreed to. The purchase of
                        Personal Training Services is a transaction between the Trainee and the Personal Trainer.
                        TRNHRD, Inc.’s role is to facilitate the transaction. We will (either directly or indirectly
                        through an authorized third Party) collect payment from the Trainee at the time of
                        Delivery and initiate payment to the Personal Trainer’s account 48 hours after Delivery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.4. Service Fees. We charge service fees for some aspects of the TRNHRD Service. If you
                        are a Personal Trainer, except where otherwise specified via the TRNHRD Service, our
                        service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Trainee agrees to pay you for
                        procurement of Personal Training Services and is collected upon Delivery. Our fee is
                        20% of the amount charged for Personal Training Services but no less than $5.00.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.5. Cancellations & Refunds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.5.1. Either Party may cancel their procurement of or providing of the Personal
                        Training Services, as the case may be, upon 48 hours or less notice (the
                        “Revocation Period”). After the Revocation Period, the Trainee is obligated to
                        pay and the Personal Trainer is obligated to provide the Personal Training
                        Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.5.2. If you wish to cancel the procurement of Personal Training Services, you should
                        use the mechanisms available through the TRNHRD Service to do so. For
                        purposes of the policies and Terms in this Section 8.5, the date of cancellation is
                        the date that you cancel through the TRNHRD Service, regardless of any
                        separate communications between users outside of the TRNHRD Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.5.3. Refunds for Failure to Perform. If we determine in our reasonable discretion that
                        a Personal Trainer has failed to provide Personal Training Services as agreed with
                        the Trainee or is otherwise in breach of these Terms, then we may, in our
                        reasonable discretion, terminate the procurement of Personal Training Services
                        or issue a full or partial refund to a Trainee or both.
                    </p>

                        8.5.4. Payment Disputes; Payment Outside of the TRNHRD Service. TRNHRD, Inc.
                        initiates payments to Personal Trainers 48 hours after Delivery. Once these
                        amounts have been disbursed, any further payment disputes are between the
                        Trainee and Personal Trainer, and TRNHRD, Inc. has no obligation to mediate
                        or facilitate any resolution. Further, TRNHRD, Inc. has no responsibility or
                        liability with respect to any tips, bonuses, or other payments made outside of the
                        TRNHRD Service.

                    <p>
                        8.6. Payment Holds. If you are a Personal Trainer, TRNHRD, Inc. reserves the right to issue
                        a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you if there is a reasonable suspicion of
                        fraudulent activity involving your account(s) or for other similarly compelling reasons
                        involving protection of TRNHRD, Inc. or the TRNHRD Services users. We may also
                        recommend that third Party payment processors restrict your access to funds in your
                        account under the foregoing circumstances.

                    <p>
                        8.7. Authorization to Charge. When you pay for Personal Training Services or for other
                        services, if any, on the TRNHRD Service, you will be required to provide us with valid,
                        up-to-date credit card or other payment information and to maintain that payment
                        information (or an acceptable alternative payment method) on file with your account so
                        long as you have any outstanding Delivery of Personal Training Services. TRNHRD,
                        Inc.’s role is to facilitate payments from Trainees to Personal Trainers as a limited
                        payment agent for the Personal Trainer. You authorize us, or our third-party payment
                        processer, to charge your credit card or other payment method for fees you incur on the
                        TRNHRD Service as they become due and payable and to charge any alternative
                        payment method TRNHRD, Inc. has on record for you in the event your primary
                        payment method is expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged. You are
                        responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information. If we cannot charge you
                        for fees when due because your payment information is no longer valid, or if we do not
                        receive your payment when due, then you understand that neither TRNHRD, Inc. nor
                        the Personal Trainer will be responsible for any failure to provide services associated
                        with those fees. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, all fees paid via the
                        TRNHRD Service are non-refundable once paid.

                        8.8. Taxes. Except for taxes on TRNHRD, Inc.’s income and gross receipts or where
                        TRNHRD, Inc. is otherwise required to collect taxes, you acknowledge that you are
                        solely responsible to pay any applicable taxes that arise as a result of your purchase,
                        provision, or use of Personal Training Services via the TRNHRD Service. This includes,

                        you through the TRNHRD Service.

                        where appropriate), your Stripe Connected Account to facilitate payment related to
                        Personal Training Services you purchase or provide. You further agree to provide
                        accurate and complete information and authorize TRNHRD, Inc. to share it and
                        transaction information with Stripe for the purposes of facilitating the payment
                        processing services provided by Stripe. TRNHRD, Inc. reserves the right to switch

                        14.1. Arbitration Agreement; Claims. This Section 17 is referred to as the "Arbitration
                        Agreement” in these Terms. You and TRNHRD, Inc. (together, the “Parties”) agree that
                        any and all disputes or claims that arise between you and TRNHRD, Inc. relating to the
                        TRNHRD Service, interactions with others on the TRNHRD Service, or these Terms
                        (including any alleged breach of these Terms) (collectively, “Claims”), except for
                        Excluded Claims, will be resolved as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. “Excluded
                        Claims” means (1) individual claims brought in small claims court (if your claims qualify),
                        (2) claims brought by TRNHRD, Inc. arising out of or related to a violation of Section
                        4.1, above, (3) claims in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for
                        alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (including, without limitation, copyrights,
                        trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents) or emergency injunctive relief
                        based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime,
                        hacking, cyber-attack), and (4) claims that an arbitrator determines cannot be made
                        subject to arbitration as described in Section 14.2 below.

                        14.2. Agreement to Arbitrate. Unless any applicable law or regulation prohibits it, You and
                        TRNHRD, Inc. agree that any and all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be
                        resolved exclusively on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, rather
                        than in a court, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and your rights in
                        connection with all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be determined by a neutral
                        arbitrator, not by a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
                        and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent that the Parties' dispute
                        involves both timely filed Excluded Claims and other Claims subject to these Terms, the
                        Parties agree to bifurcate and stay for the duration of the arbitration proceedings any
                        such Excluded Claims. If there is a final determination by the arbitrator (or the court, if
                        required by law) that applicable law precludes enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement
                        as to any claim, cause of action, or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action, or
                        requested remedy will be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining Claim,

                        claim or any particular remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief),
                        then: (i) that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) shall
                        be severed from any remaining claims and/or remedies and stayed; (ii) this Section 17.3
                        shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all such remaining claims or
                        remedies to the fullest extent possible; and (iii) the stayed claims and/or remedies may be
                        brought in a court of competent jurisdiction after all remaining claims are resolved by
                        the arbitrator.

                        14.4. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Our preference will always be to resolve complaints
                        amicably and efficiently, without the need for arbitration. Before you commence
                        arbitration, you agree to first contact us in writing to explain your complaint and give us
                        an opportunity to work with you to resolve it.  Your legal representative, if you have one,
                        may contact us by mail at TRNHRD, Inc., 300 South Central Avenue, Apt. A41,
                        Hartsdale, NY 10530. Your written complaint should include your name, the email
                        address associated with your account, a detailed description of the nature and basis of
                        the dispute, and the specific relief sought. Your written complaint must be on an
                        individual basis and personally signed, as articulated in these Terms. For any dispute that
                        TRNHRD, Inc. initiates, a written complaint will be signed by a TRNHRD, Inc.
                        representative and sent to the email address associated with your account. If the issue is
                        not resolved within 30 days after receipt of the written complaint, either Party may
                        initiate arbitration as specified in section 14.5 “Arbitration Procedures.”

                        14.5. Arbitration Procedures. The Parties will try in good faith to mutually select and agree
                        upon an arbitrator and rules and procedures to govern the arbitration. If the Parties
                        cannot agree, then the arbitration will be conducted in English by a neutral arbitrator in
                        accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”;
                        https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. The rules that apply are those
                        in effect when arbitration either Party demands arbitration. The Rules are incorporated
                        in these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that You have read and
                        understand the Rules or waive Your opportunity to read the Rules and any claim that the
                        Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. If there is any inconsistency between
                        the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, in that case, the terms of this Arbitration
                        Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
                        inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                        arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court
                        would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 16.
                        Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials
                        and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on
                        an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and
                        applicable law. The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing, specifying the findings of
                        fact and the conclusions of the law on which the decision is based. Decisions by the
                        arbitrator are binding and enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only
                        for very limited reasons.

                        14.6. Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, case management, and
                        arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the applicable
                        Rules.  Each Party will be solely responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with
                        the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. At the end of any
                        arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs or any portion
                        thereof to either Party upon determining that the claim, cross-claim, or defense is
                        frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal
                        Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)) to the extent authorized by applicable law.

                        14.7. Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or

                        14.8. Severability. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or
                        unenforceable, it will be held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms,
                        clauses and provisions of this Section 14 will remain valid and enforceable.

                        14.9. Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in these
                        Terms to the contrary, you agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration
                        Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in
                        the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding
                        against TRNHRD, Inc. prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we
                        terminate this Arbitration Agreement by removing it from these Terms, such termination
                        will not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the
                        Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and will not be effective as to any claim that
                        was filed in a legal proceeding against TRNHRD, Inc. prior to the effective date of
                        removal.
